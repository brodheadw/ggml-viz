  - File size monitoring with detailed change notifications
  - Improved new event detection and loading from external files
- **Immediate file flushing** - Critical for live mode responsiveness
  - Force disk sync after each graph computation
  - Platform-specific sync calls (F_FULLFSYNC on macOS, fsync on Linux)
  - Ensures external applications can immediately see trace updates

### Technical Improvements

## [0.2.0] - 2025-07-01

### Added
- **Performance Benchmarking Infrastructure** - Complete benchmarking system with statistical analysis
- **BENCHMARKING.md** - Comprehensive guide for performance measurement  
- Comprehensive User Guide (USER_GUIDE.md) with llama.cpp integration examples
- Updated project documentation with accurate feature status
- Fixed macOS build instructions with Metal backend workaround
- Auto-start functionality when `GGML_VIZ_OUTPUT` environment variable is set

### Changed
- Updated README.md with accurate feature status (removed incorrect "Beta" labels)
- Corrected CLI usage documentation to reflect actual environment variable approach
- Updated CLAUDE.md with current build process and known issues
- Modified test mode to use manual hook calling instead of function interposition

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL BUG**: Zero event recording issue in hook instrumentation system
  - Fixed `GGML_VIZ_TEST_MODE` preventing function overrides from being compiled
  - Added proper environment variable parsing (`GGML_VIZ_OUTPUT`, `GGML_VIZ_DISABLE`, `GGML_VIZ_MAX_EVENTS`)
  - Implemented auto-start functionality for hooks when environment variables are set
  - Test now records 60 events instead of 0, trace files now 3.3KB instead of 12 bytes (header only)
  - Fixed duplicate symbol linker errors in test builds
- macOS Metal shader compilation issues (use -DGGML_METAL=OFF as workaround)
- GUI dependencies properly linked with 9 macOS frameworks (Cocoa, OpenGL, AppKit, etc.)

### Critical Issues Discovered
- **Broken Event Capture System** - Instrumentation hooks not recording GGML operations (0 events captured)
- **Environment Variable Issues** - GGML_VIZ_OUTPUT not being respected by test applications

## [0.1.0] - 2025-07-01
